# pmkisan
A clone of pmkisan.gov.in 

## Why?
If you have had the misfortune of having to use pmkisan.gov.in,
you know exactly why. The site's session management is bugged,
it runs on windows server and running an outdated apache server

## Wait, How do you know these things?
If you were super frustrated by the crashes of the site like me,
you can see that the server is running in debug mode because whenever 
it crashed, it showed the full stacktrace with server version and the
culprit file. Also, most of the indian government sites run on Apache server

## Dosen't this mean that these sites can be easily be attacked via ddos
Yes, yes it does, i dont remember which version of apache server the site was
running, but it was definitly outdated

## So are you going to implement the whole thing?
Yes

## Roadmap

 [  ] Implement a basic no css ui
 [  ] Implement basic registeration functionality in the server
